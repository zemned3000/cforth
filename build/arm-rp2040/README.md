C Forth for RP2040
======================

C Forth is a Forth implementation by Mitch Bradley, optimised for embedded use in semi-constrained systems such as System-on-Chip processors.  See https://github.com/MitchBradley/cforth.git

Please ensure the PICO SDK is installed, which can be found here ->  https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git

Testing has been performed on Raspbian as a cross compiler, with the PICO connected to the Raspberry PI USB and UART GPIO pins. The wiring for this can be found in the excellent "Getting Started With the Raspberry PI Pico" document and the RP2040 Datasheet.

This is an initial build of C Forth for the RP2040.
